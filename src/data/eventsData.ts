    "description": "ROUND 1 – UNO Frenzy\nThink UNO is just a card game? Think again!\nIn this fast-paced face-off, two teams battle it out as players draw cards from their decks. But beware — special cards don’t just change the game, they trigger surprise challenges! From quick tasks to fun mini-activities, every draw could flip the game in unexpected ways. Stay sharp, think fast, and prove your team can handle both strategy and surprise.\n\nROUND 2 – Drama & Deception\nTeams step into the spotlight in this exciting blend of dumb charades and myth-busting. Players must creatively act out a hidden word related to the theme while their teammates race against time to guess it. Once the clock stops, a statement is revealed — but is it fact or fiction? Teams must put their knowledge to the test and decide whether the statement is a myth or the truth .\n\nROUND 3-  Challenge Chase\nGet ready for the ultimate test of teamwork and energy!\n In this thrilling relay challenge, teams must race against each other while completing a series of tasks along the way. Each member must finish their challenge before passing the baton to the next teammate. It’s not just about speed — strategy, quick thinking, and teamwork will decide who crosses the finish line first.",
